Folder Locations
================

In order to differentiate between original animations and retargeted animations, animations are located inside two different folders. Original Animations are inside the :abbr:`üìÅAnimations (Content\\Charles\\üìÅAnimations)` folder while Retargeted Animations are inside the :abbr:`üìÅDemo (Content\\Charles\\Demo)` folder.

In fact, since there are almost no original animations (besides a facial morph target animation :guilabel:`Anim_smile_blink`), you will find **most** of the animation in the :abbr:`üìÅDemo (Content\\Charles\\Demo)` folder. This folder contains a few animations retargeted from UE4 Mannequin, Paragon's Kwang and Anim Starter Pack.

The mannequin's animations are retargeted with UE4 while Paragon's and Anim Starter's animation are retargeting inside Maya using HumanIK.

Retargeting Animations
======================

Since Charles's skeleton is a different proportion than UE4 skeleton which most animation in the marketplace is based on, you will have to do some retargeting for animation.

Documentation:
   You can read more about retargeting for UE4 at the official `Unreal Engine 4.27 Documentation - Animation Retargeting <https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/AnimatingObjects/SkeletalMeshAnimation/AnimationRetargeting/>`_, and UE5 at `Unreal Engine 5.0 Documentation - IK Rig Retargeting <https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/ik-rig-animation-retargeting-in-unreal-engine/>`_.

Below is some step by step instructions:

.. note::
	The following guide is for another character Meryl but it should also works the same for Charles.

Unreal Engine 4
---------------

.. note::
	Step by Step Video at Youtube:
		`Animation Retargeting in UE4 // Meryl <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqlSjc5xunU>`_

Step1: 

 - Select the animations that you want to retarget from
 
 - Right click on them and choose *Retarget Anim Assets -> Duplicate Anim Assets and Retarget*

Step2: 

 - In the "Select Skeleton" pop up Window...
 
 - Uncheck "Show Only Compatible Skeletons"
 
 - Select SK_Charles_Skeleton
 
 - Change the output location if you want

 - Click on Retarget.

.. _retarget_ue5:

Unreal Engine 5
---------------

UE5 has a different retargeting process from UE4 which involve creating an IK Rig first for the character. But don't worry it's already been setup and you can find it under :folder:`Charles ‚ûß Meshes ‚ûß UE5` (< IK_Charles >).

.. warning::
   Note that the following guide is made for another character Meryl and I have modified the text to show Charles but the images remains the one from Meryl. I have tested it to verify the steps can be applied to Charles too.

Create IK Retargeter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   #. Note that you will need < IK_Charles > and < SK_Charles_UE5 > and they are inside folder :folder:`Charles ‚ûß Meshes ‚ûß UE5`

      .. image:: /images/animations/retarget-ue5-copy-asset.jpg
		:align: center

   #. Go to folder :folder:`Characters ‚ûß Mannequins ‚ûß Rigs`,
     
	  Duplicate < RTG_Mannequin > and name it < RTG_Charles_to_UE5 > 

	  .. image:: /images/animations/retarget-ue5-duplicate-retargeter.jpg
		:align: center

   #. Open < RTG_Charles_to_UE5 >
     
	  Set the **Target IKRig** to < IK_Charles > and **Target Preview Mesh** to < SK_Charles_UE5 >

	  .. image:: /images/animations/retarget-ue5-set-target-ikrig.jpg
		:align: center

      |

	  I find that I also need to turn OFF the **Retarget IK** option otherwise the retargeted animation looks strange.

	  .. image:: /images/animations/retarget-ue5-turn-off-retarget-ik.jpg
		:align: center

   #. Switch to **Asset Browser** panel and play some animations to check if everything looks alright

|

Duplicate Animation Blueprint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   #. Go to folder :folder:`Characters ‚ûß Mannequins ‚ûß Animations`,

      Right click on < ABP_Manny > and select **Retarget Animation Assets ‚ûß Duplicate and Retarget Animation Blueprint**

	  .. image:: /images/animations/retarget-ue5-retarget-animbp.jpg
		:align: center

   #. In the "Duplicate and Retarget Animation Blueprint" Window,

      Set IK Retargeter to < RTG_Charles_to_UE5 >

      Set Search "Manny" and Replace "Charles"

      Set the output Folder to :folder:`Charles ‚ûß Demo`

	  .. image:: /images/animations/retarget-ue5-retarget-animbp-window.jpg
		:align: center
	
	  |

      Hit the "Retarget" Button. You will find the retargeted animations and anim blueprint at the folder you set above.

|

Duplicate Character Blueprint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   #. Go to folder :folder:`ThirdPerson ‚ûß Blueprints`,

      Duplicate < BP_ThirdPersonCharacter > and name it < BP_Charles_UE5 >

	  .. image:: /images/animations/retarget-ue5-duplicate-bp.jpg
		:align: center

   #. Open the blueprint < BP_Charles_UE5 >,

      Change the mesh to < SK_Charles_UE5 > and set the animation blueprint to < ABP_Charles >

	  .. image:: /images/animations/retarget-ue5-edit-bp.jpg
		:align: center

   #. Compile and Save

|

Set Player
^^^^^^^^^^

   #. In the World Settings, under **Game Mode ‚ûß Selected GameMode**,

      Set **Default Pawn Class** to < BP_Charles_UE5 > (created from the step above)

	  .. image:: /images/animations/retarget-ue5-world-settings.jpg
		:align: center

   #. Play the game to see the retargeted character.
